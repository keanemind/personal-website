The last time I worked on Lost-n-Phoned was exactly 7 months ago. Now that my portfolio website is on the internet, I need to fill it up with projects. Lost-n-Phoned is definitely something I want on my websiteâ€”the only problem is that it's not _quite_ portfolio-worthy yet. The website is basically nonexistent and the service still doesn't have an authentication scheme, which is required if it's ever going to go live for the public to use. Even if the code was complete, there'd still be the fact that I shut down the Digital Ocean droplet running it half a year ago.

This weekend I hope to get the project up and running again. I'm not sure how long it will take, but as of now, I'm halfway done with setting up the server. What I suspect will take longest is implementing some form of security for returning people's phone numbers. 

My main concern is that I will be splitting my time between Lost-n-Phoned, learning React, and catching up in my EE 313 class. I know for sure I won't be able to meet my goals for all three; I just don't know which ones, if any, will be accomplished. Here's to a productive weekend!
