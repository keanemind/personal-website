On Saturday and Sunday, Bala, Kunal, and I attended the AngelHack hackathon in Austin. We spent our weekend working on Bala's idea, which is a platform to make Ethereum donations to people raising funds for charity. The platform, called Trust Me, ensures that the donated Ethereum can only be sent to the charity's account.

While Bala and Kunal worked on writing the Solidity code, I worked exclusively on the project's website. The website is the place where donors can browse fundraisers and donate Ethereum.

It was the first time in my life that I made a decent-looking site without using any templates. I did rely significantly on [Picnic CSS](https://picnicss.com/) to make a grid of fundraiser cards, but that was the extent of outside code I used.

I used lots of images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) as backdrops to informational text. Surprisingly, Arial didn't look bad at all so I didn't end up using any Google Fonts.

At Bala's request, I used JavaScript to add a fade transition that changes the website hero image periodically. The result impressed even me!

I decided to add the Trust Me site and the HTML5 2048 game (which is now complete) to my portfolio site at [KeaneNguyen.com](https://www.keanenguyen.com/). However, I had a lot of trouble making images of the projects look good in the layout that I'm currently using for that site. 

With the boost in confidence from the outcome of the Trust Me site, I have decided to write my own portfolio page from the ground up; I don't want to use any CSS libraries or templates. If I'm going to be a front end developer after all, then I need to be able to design my own page!

As of now, I plan to design the website by making my very own Hugo template.
