The only coding I did today was for EE 312 Software Design and Implementation I. I have been tasked with writing functions to perform matrix multiplication and transposition using pointers and `malloc()` calls. I haven't had much difficulty so far, but I need to be extra thorough with my test cases for this project because I missed several corner cases on my previous assignment.
