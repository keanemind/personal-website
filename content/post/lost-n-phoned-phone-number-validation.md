I've finally added phone number validation to Lost-n-Phoned! I made use of the phonenumbers package on pip. Unfortunately, the feature required me to add multiple complex if branches, but I don't think it's too bad.

You can format your phone number in any reasonable way when querying for your contacts now. Also, you have to register on the phone with the phone number you want to register. This keeps people from registering phone numbers that aren't theirs.

The final hurdle is here: the security scheme, which I haven't even decided upon, let alone implemented.
