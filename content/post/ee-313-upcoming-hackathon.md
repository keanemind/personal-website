Unfortunately, this week I will be very busy with my EE 313 Linear Systems and Signals class. I have homework due Wednesday and an exam on Friday. The material has been very difficult for me to understand so far, especially because I don't have a good grasp on the mathematics the course is built upon. This means I will likely not have time for anything other than schoolwork until next weekend. 

In other, more cheerful news, I am planning to attend the upcoming AngelHack Austin hackathon with some of my friends. I might make another update on that later.
