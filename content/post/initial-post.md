I’m creating this site as a new format for journaling my incremental work on tech projects over time. I intend to write updates here that act like longer git commits for each day.

Today I’ve been working on setting this site up. I spent a long time looking through the HTML and CSS files in the Base16 Hugo theme that this site is running on. In the end, I only changed the font and the color gradient image at the top of the site. I would have liked to add an About page, but when I tried to, Hugo built the page as a *list*-type page instead of a *single*-type page. I need to find out how to make the About page the correct type so that I can write in it, but I don’t know when I’ll get around to it. 

My main priority for the next day or two is getting Netlify CMS up and running on this site and on [Thoughts](https://thoughts.keanenguyen.com). I’m hoping there won’t be many issues because I want to start working with React JS as soon as possible.
