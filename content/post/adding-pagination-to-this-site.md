I woke up this morning and browsed to this site on my phone to take a look at how last night's post looked. For the first time, I realized that it was completely impossible to access posts other than the latest three shown on the homepage.

To fix this, I looked through Hugo's docs on pagination and the code from a different theme, [Hestia Pure](https://github.com/diwao/hestia-pure). Using what I learned, I updated [my fork of the Base16 theme](https://github.com/keanemind/hugo-base16-theme), which this site uses, and added page navigation links to the bottom of the homepage. I then submitted a pull request to the original theme, since there's already an issue open there requesting pagination.

Enjoy reading through my older posts!
