NetlifyCMS is one of the coolest projects I've ever seen. When I first read its setup docs, the steps were so simple that I got confused. It took me a long time to realize that one index.html page is all it needs because the index page pulls everything else from a CDN! I now have NetlifyCMS on both [Thoughts](https://thoughts.keanenguyen.com/) and [Techlog](https://techlog.keanenguyen.com/), and I'm using it to write and publish this post.
