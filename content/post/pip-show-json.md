My [pull request to pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/5514) just passed all of Travis' tests for the first time. I've spent many of the past 48 hours working with my roommate to make our first contribution to Python pip. Our change is really small and simple, but it was *very* difficult for us to get even a basic understanding of the pip source code. Right now we don't even know how to test our changes! Hopefully we can fix any mistakes (with the help of pip maintainers) and eventually get the pull request merged.
