I've now set up the necessary data structures and the operations on them required for the `render()` function to know how to animate the correct blocks. Tomorrow I will work on the animating itself. Right now, the update.js file is a huge headache to deal with. It is literally 100% spaghetti code (I'm partially to blame) and it needs to be rewritten from scratch as soon as possible. I should have changed Bala's madness before starting the animation code, but it might be too late now.
