Lost-n-Phoned is almost ready for general public use. I'm currently going through Google's OAuth Developer Verification to get rid of the "This app isn't verified" warning that shows up when anyone tries to register. It's a slow process involving back and forth emailing.

So what's next after Lost-n-Phoned? This month, I will focus on finishing strong in my EE 312 class, designing/building my portfolio website, and practicing interview problems. I might also be starting a new student organization at UT, but I'm not 100% on that quite yet.

I want to relax during this last month before the Fall semester starts again, so I probably won't be coding with the same intensity as before (which means less posts here). I'll definitely make up for it, considering that I will be taking both EE461S (Operating Systems) and EE422C (Software Design and Implementation II).
