Over the past few days, I've managed to make the game scale for mobile devices. On smaller screens, the game's iPhone simulation goes away and the game does its best to go full screen. I even added a bit of JavaScript scaling inside the canvas element itself, in addition to CSS. This makes the game look better on different screens.

Thanks to Kunal, the game also now accepts touch input. He's working on giving the game sounds in this very moment.
