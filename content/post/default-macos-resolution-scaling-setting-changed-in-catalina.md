Since I can find no reference to this anywhere on the internet, I would like to note that the default MacOS resolution scaling setting appears to have changed between Mojave and Catalina. The former's default is "Looks like 1280 x 800", whereas the latter's default is "Looks like 1440 x 900". I discovered this while investigating why the MacOS UI appeared larger on my friend's laptop, which is a 13 inch MacBook Pro like mine.
