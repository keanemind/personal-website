I've been following the Flask tutorial and am currently a little more than halfway through it. Most of the things I've learned are Flask features that I didn't know existed, like blueprints, views, and templates (yeah, I didn't know much about Flask). It's going to take me longer than I thought to get a solid grasp of what's going on in the tutorial project.
