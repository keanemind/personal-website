Yesterday and today, I have been working on problems from TJCTF. To my surprise, I found them highly addictive. I think it's mainly because the problems are at a level where I have a fair chance of success; the last CTF I participated in was far too difficult for me. However, TJCTF is targetted toward high-schoolers. The most interesting (and painful) problems I worked on had to do with analyzing binaries and reading assembly code.

I am considering writing some write-ups for the problems and putting them in a GitHub repository. I think I would find the write-ups useful in the future if I do more CTF competitions. This event has reignited in me an interest in security engineering, and I'm going to start reading Ross Anderson's book on the subject.
