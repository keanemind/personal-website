The first of the three things in the title I'm going to write about today is the [`pip show` pull request](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/5514) I worked on earlier this week. As it turns out, Kunal and I had misunderstood how the pip maintainers wanted to fix the issue we were working on. The change they wanted was only a [documentation update](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/5517), and not a new flag. Unfortunately, this meant that all the code we had written was for naught, and I had to close the original PR we opened. 

On another note, I have finally started learning React JS. My primary motivation is my desire to build web apps with the framework, but another significant incentive is the high demand for it from employers. It's important for me to acquire some marketable skills right now, as I will be applying for summer 2019 internships within a few months. 

Lastly, I just want to say that I have acquired the domain name WholesomeBoard.com. As soon as I am half competent with React, I want to start working on reviving the [Wholesome Board](https://github.com/usmanhf/wholesome-hacks-try-2) project I made with my team at Wholesome Hacks. The latest version of the code is currently on my branch in the repository, if you want to look at it. The version of the code that we demoed with is [here](https://github.com/usmanhf/wholesome-hacks-try-2/tree/f7ad1321257249130c7bae2eec068b7e2a895338).
